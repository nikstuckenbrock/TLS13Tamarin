# Batch-Tamarin recipe

This model makes use of a python wrapper for Tamarin models called [Batch-Tamarin](https://github.com/tamarin-prover/batch-tamarin).
It helps to (re)proof all lemmas in a resource efficient manner.
After installing Batch-Tamarin one can navigate to `src` and then simply run `batch-tamarin run recipe.json` to reproof all automatic lemmas.
