# TLS 1.3 Tamarin model

This is a Tamarin Prover model of TLS 1.3.
It is based on the [work from Cas Cremers, Marko Horvat, Jonathan Hoyland, Sam Scott and Thyla van der Merwe](https://tls13tamarin.github.io/TLS13Tamarin/).
For a detailed information take a look at the [documentation](https://nikstuckenbrock.github.io/TLS13Tamarin/).
The proofs generated for this model are too large to track in a forked repository, therefor the repository [nikstuckenbrock/TLS13Tamarin-proofs](https://github.com/nikstuckenbrock/TLS13Tamarin-proofs) holds all proofs.
All proofs related to this model are in the [ref-rfc-8446 subfolder](https://github.com/nikstuckenbrock/TLS13Tamarin-proofs/tree/main/ref-rfc-8446).
